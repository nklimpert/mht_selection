fixes to scripts

in alignment_concatenator.py, on lines 45 & 62
original:
if(record.seq == gapSeq): 
new:
if (str(record.seq).upper().replace("N", "-")) == gapSeq:

in make_relax_tree.py on lines 39 & 49
same as above - also changed the script to have a variable called gapSeq to make it the same as alignment_concatenator.py

in paml.py on lines 52 & 63,
same change as in make_relax_tree.py
